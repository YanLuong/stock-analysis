# stock-analysis

*This analysis report will discuss whether refactoring the existing code has made it more efficient and viable so that it can accomodate larger data sets in the future.*

### Overview of project and background

This project will refactor existing code on behalf of Steve. His workbook currently analyses a small number of stocks and returns the performance of the stocks that he is interested in. He is looking to expand his data sets which his current workbook is not set up for.      

#### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to refactor the existing code on Steve's workbook to make it more scalable. This will allow him to potentially expand his datasets to include the entire stock market and cover more historical performance over the years as his requirements change.
